# Sputnik

Sputnik is a library of sparse linear algebra kernels and utilities for deep learning.

## Build

Sputnik uses the CMake build system. Sputnik depends on the CUDA toolkit (v10.1+) and supports SM70+. The only additional dependency for the library is [google/glog](https://github.com/google/glog). To build the library, enter the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCUDA_ARCHS=75 # where 75 is cuda sm arch sm_75, to find correct arch for your nvidia GPU check https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/
make -j12
```

The test and benchmark suites additionally depend on [abseil/abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp), [google/googltest](https://github.com/google/googletest), and [google/benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark). These dependencies are includes as submodules in [third_party](https://github.com/google-research/sputnik/tree/os-build/third_party). To build the test suite and/or benchmark suite, set `-DBUILD_TEST=ON` and/or `-DBUILD_BENCHMARK=ON` in your `cmake` command.

`cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TEST=ON -DBUILD_BENCHMARK=ON -DCUDA_ARCHS="70;75"`

## Docker

Sputnik provides a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/google-research/sputnik/blob/os-build/Dockerfile) that builds the proper environment with all dependencies. Note that [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) must be installed to run on GPU. To build the image, run the following command:

`docker build . -t sputnik-dev`

To launch the container with the sputnik source mounted under `/mount` (assuming you're working out of $HOME), run the following:

`sudo docker run --runtime=nvidia -v ~/:/mount/ -it sputnik-dev:latest`
